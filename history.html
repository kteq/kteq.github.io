    In 1922, a handful of energetic Electrical Engineering students established the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology's very first campus radio station. WCAT, or Wildcat Radio, began operating from the school's Physical Education building on the commercial AM band. Initially airing mostly news and informational programming, the station's popularity grew steadily through the 1940's and 50's with the inclusion of basketball games and music that was unique and popular for the era. Unfortunately, WCAT's rich broadcasting history met an abrupt end in 1952 when it was pressured off the air by a competing commercial station.

    In 1969, after a nineteen year broadcasting hiatus, student body president Jim McGibbney spearheaded an effort to broadcast a program of current events on the Tech campus. With the assistance of announcer Greg Carey, McGibbney gained Student Association support to form the Tech Educational Radio Council (TERC). Plans for Tech's second fully-operational radio station were set in motion. In following two years a mountain of triplicate forms were filed with the FCC, space was secured for a new studio in the Surbeck Center, and tower space for the new station's antenna was donated by KBHE. Then on August 7, 1971, KTEQ touched the airwaves surrounding the SDSM&T campus, breaking nearly two decades of radio silence.

    <h4 class="text-center">EARLY KTEQ HISTORY ACCORDING TO GARY BROWN</h4>
    <p class="text-center">
    Before KTEQ came up, we had a weekly radio show called "Hardrocker 
    Highlights" on KOTA. From '68 to '71 I did it with Karl Gerdes. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    I worked with Greg back in '71 to get KTEQ up on the air, and was its first 
    station manager. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    To get our license, we went up to Skyline Drive and had the religious 
    station (it's call sign escapes me now) reduce its power to 10W. We put a 
    homemade antenna on a broomstick and then travelled around Rapid seeing how 
    the signal was. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    To get our original record library, I called up the VPs of marketting for 
    all the major labels in the US. I called collect and, amazingly, they 
    almost all accepted! 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    I was the first person on the air. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    The first broadcast opened with "Also Sprach Zarathustra" as the signon 
    theme (instead of the Star Spangled Banner). Remember..."2001 A Space 
    Odyssey" had just come out! 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    The "Alternative Radio for the Black Hills" slogan dates right from the 
    start. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    The on-air auction was modelled after the auctions on Chicago radio stations. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    When we started off, we broadcast tapes from Radio Moscow! You can bet that 
    hacked off a lot of people...and probably got me on an FBI list of some sort 
    or another. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    Using the old state CENTREX lines, KTEQ was the originator of the first 
    all-state radio broadcast. There was a panel discussion on prison reform. 
    I patched through Surbeck Center into our panel, and then used the CENTREX 
    lines to send a feed out to the other college stations in the state.

    <p class="text-center">
    Geo. McGovern was interviewed on the air for the '72 election. You should 
    have seen the secret service spooks go through the office!
